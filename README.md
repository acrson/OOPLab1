Object Oriented Programming with Java, Lab 1: "Making Change"

This program will take a double as an amount of money then convert that into the amount in the smallest amount of denominations possible.
For example, "3.44" (representing $3.44) would be converted to 3 one dollar bills, 1 quarter, 1 dime, 1 nickel, and 4 pennies.
Then, using GUI, that many of each denomination will be displayed to the screen, showing a visual representation of the money.
